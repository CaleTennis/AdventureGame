# AdventureGame
A game solely developed by myself to challenge my programming abilities

# Main Features:
- Randomly generated enemies with health and damage scaling based on player level
- Random loot dropped by enemies with different damages/rarities, also scaled to player level
- Player and enemy health tracker along with health restoration through resting 

# Note: 
Some features implemented in the code are missing in the game since it was converted from a text-based display to an interactive display using the windows library.
